## Digital Story

"how you have grown and come to new understandings through your experiences in this class"

- 3-4 minutes of > 5 images with voiceover and music/SFX
- Narrative arc; my learning journey:

1. My background in engineering, stakeholdership vs relationality, design praxis vs biocultural praxis, systems thinking vs land-people-culture thinking, and the importance of storytelling in engineering:
  1. Controlled environment agriculture journey, choosing a challenge over choosing a passion (eng over ag), and dealing with disappointment and failure (IMAGE: DAVE)
  2. Intelligent design and relationality in stakeholdership, consideration of perspectives and values, and placing your focus where it matters most (IMAGE: CHESTNUT MEAL PLAN SURVEY & REPORT)
  3. Personal growth and resetting priorities, the importance of personal relationships and community, and the significance of solving "people problems" over technical feats
2. Discovery of a love for the environment and transfer to Trent, the importance of the land and Indigenous knowledge, and what I've learned so far:
   1. SAFS: Organic, regenerative, sustainability
   2. ERSC: SDGs, Climate Change, and resource exploitation
   3. IESS: Biocultural Framework, Oral Sources of Inherited Knowledge, and the significance of diverse sources of truth in constructing a worldview for problem-solving/engineering in the post-modern age
3. Where do we go from here?
   1. Treaties: land, agreements, and friendship; Permits and regulations on resource extraction in indigenous context; In the same way that individuals require treaties to liberate themselves from institutional tyranny, the "bioculture" needs treaties to liberate itself from individual tyranny/exploitation of ecosystem services/unsustainable practices.
   2. Wildlife dissapearance due to trophic collapse; loss of biodiversity/indicator species of climate change; loss of traditional food and medicine sources (ORAL SOURCE: Q&A with Former Chief Jonas Sangris of Athabaskan People in Yellowknife)
   3. What stories are we telling ourselves? Importance of accuracy in any "doomsday clock" "device"; Necessity of indigenous apocalyptic narratives a-la-Revelations - the Horsemen have come and gone; what now? "Oui - et ca devient possible"
   4. Evolution of storytelling of the post-modern age; Spiritual winter reminds us to love what we had; Preparation for an uncertain future (this century); Interplanetary Settlement and Global Sovereign Indigenous Identity of Humanity to the Earth
