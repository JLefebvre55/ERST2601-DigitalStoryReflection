# Digital Story Voice-Over Script

## Introduction

I am, first and foremost, an engineer. I like to frame problems in such a way that solutions become self-evident combinations of predetermined elements. While this is ultimately effective, and limitations enable creativity, I have come to understand through my participation in this course that holistic humanist approaches to problem-solving require an inculcated understanding of the interconnectedness and togetherness of all layers of reality, from the theological and spiritual to the deterministic and material.

I have chosen to take the time allocated for this digital story to reflect on a series of engineering projects I have undertaken - both academic and entrepreneurial - and to examine how my understanding of each problem could have been better served with my newfound understanding of myself, the stakeholders involved, and the world at large.

## DAVE

> Not about the plants, but about the technology. Should have been about food and the people that grow, prepare, and eat it.

## Chestnut Residence Meal Plan Report

> Not about eating, but about economics. Should have been about making sure students don't go hungry.

## Clothing-assistive Reidentification Device (CaRD)

> Not about people with visual impairment, but about prototyping. Should have been about helping people in need.

## Conclusion

More about something working than about helping people, BECAUSE it was academic.
