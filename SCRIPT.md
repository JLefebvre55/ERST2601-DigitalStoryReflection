# Digital Story Voice-Over Script

## Introduction

I am, first and foremost, an engineer. I like to frame problems in such a way that solutions become self-evident combinations of predetermined elements. While this is ultimately effective, and limitations enable creativity, I have come to understand through my participation in this course that holistic humanist approaches to problem-solving require an inculcated understanding of the interconnectedness and togetherness of all layers of reality, from the theological and spiritual to the deterministic and material.

I have chosen to take the time allocated for this digital story to reflect on a series of engineering projects I have undertaken - both academic and entrepreneurial - and to examine how my undertaking of each problem could have been better served with my newfound understanding of myself, the stakeholders involved, and the world at large.

## DAVE

> Not about the plants, but about the technology. Should have been about food and the people that grow, prepare, and eat it.

The footage I have selected for this component of my story is a time-lapse of the growth of *Wasabia japonica* plants I grew in a prototype micro-greenhouse, designed as part of a course I took in my final year of highschool. As part of this project, I developed and implemented a research plan, cumulating in a paper that was ultimately submitted and accepted for publication. Over the course of this endeavour, my teacher repeatedly inquired whether my focus was on the tech I was developing, or the food I was growing. I never gave her a straight answer.

My primary goal was to employ chemical analysis techniques to determine whether intensive controlled-environment agriculture would increase the concentrations of the primary phytochemical compound responsible for the pungent aroma of wasabii, for which the ingredient is prized. While I was ultimately successful, the samples I grew did not taste good. At all. I was so focused on the technology at hand that I neglected the food itself, and the people that grow, prepare, and eat it.

## Chestnut Residence Meal Plan Report

> Not about eating, but about economics. Should have been about making sure students don't go hungry.

This next project was an economic report I prepared for my dorm floor don based on a survey conducted on the meal-plan spending habits of students at a UofT residence. The paper found that, under the new "declining-balance" debit model (as opposed to the former all-you-care-to-eat model, which was widely lauded as both fair and successful) students were ultimately doomed to pay for months of food out-of-pocket; the meal plan was simply too expensive to be sustainable.

I submitted my findings, but ultimately in vain - nothing changed. If I had taken this course on indigenous knowledge systems prior to my time at UofT, I would have committed myself fully to activism on behalf of the students I lived with, and rather than focussing on the economic infeasibility of an unjust system, gone out of my way to make sure nobody went hungry.

## Clothing-assistive Reidentification Device (CaRD)

> Not about people with visual impairment, but about prototyping. Should have been about helping people in need.

The final project I will share with you was a prototype I engineered in response to a reqeust for proposals to develop solutions for those with visual impairment. The specific task was to aid in the identification of clothing items in a wardrobe. I developed a standalone device from off-the-shelf compononts that anybody could build from my open-sourced design plans that was able to associate NFC tags - like those in "tappable" debit cards - with audio files recorded by the user.

While the device did work as intended, nobody ever used it. I was so focussed on the prototyping and the technology that I neglected the people I was trying to help. If I had focussed on learning more about the day-to-day habits of those with visual impa irments - to learn their stories - I would have gone with a simpler solution more tailored to their needs, rather than one that suit my interests.

## Conclusion

Each of these projects was more about something working than about helping people, BECAUSE they were an academic endeavours. My learning in this course has set a new standard of expectations for holistic teaching and learning in the sciences, and a novel understanding that storytelling around people and their values should be the utmost priority in any design task.
